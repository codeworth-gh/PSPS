= Views

include::_attributes.adoc[]

PSPS users https://getbootstrap.com[Bootstrap 4] for its page templates. The `views` package contains many facilities for supporting common HTML use-cases -- most of them are detailed below.

== Page Templates
 
`bsBase.scala.html`::
    Base template. Includes Bootstrap, the <<javascript-interop.adoc#feRoutes, front-end Javascript router>>, CSRF token, and common Javascript files.

`bsNavbar.scala.html`::
    Extends `bsBase` with a nav-bar.

`frontEndBase.scala.html`::
    Extends `bsNavBar` with the nav data for the public section.

`backEndBase.scala.html`::
    Extends `bsNavBar` with the nav data for the back-office section. Also includes the back-end Javascript router.

[NOTE]
Bootstrap 4 uses https://jquery.org[JQuery], and thus PSPS views include it as well. This dependency will be removed when Bootstrap 5 is released.

== Type-safe Navigation Menus

Using pre-defined tree structure, developers can describe the site
navigation structure. The UI templates will draw the structure,
including drop-down items etc. The structure can be static or dynamic (e.g. composed based on user permissions).

For example, the following code: 

[source,scala]
----
object Structure {
  
 val publicItems:Seq[TopSiteSection[PublicSections.Value]] = Seq(
   PageSection("navbar.publicHome", PublicSections.Home, routes.HomeCtrl.index),
   PageSection("navbar.login", PublicSections.Login, routes.UserCtrl.showLogin),
   MultiPageSection("navbar.components", PublicSections.Components,
     Seq(
       PageSectionItem("pageTitleRow.title", routes.HomeCtrl.pageTitleRow()),
       PageSectionItem("pager.title", routes.HomeCtrl.pager(1)),
       PageSectionItem("informationals.title", routes.HomeCtrl.informationals),
       PageSectionItem("styledInputs.title", routes.HomeCtrl.styledInputs),
       JsSectionItem("jsSectionItem.title", Html("swal('This can be any JS code')"))
     )
   ),
   MultiPageSection("Other", PublicSections.Others,
     Seq(
       PageSectionItem("navbar.login", routes.UserCtrl.showLogin),
       SeparatorSectionItem,
       PageSectionItem("navbar.publicHome", routes.HomeCtrl.index)
     )
   )
 )
  ...
}
----

Results in:

[NOTE]
File menu:views[Structure.scala] contains the classes and structures of the public and back-office site areas.

== Page Title Row

It is very common to have a title on a page, sometimes with a subtitle, sometimes with another component (e.g. page-wide action buttons), and sometimes with both. These titles involve some boilerplate, e.g. `<div class="row"><div class="col"><h1>TITLE GOES HERE</...`.

Because we're not happy to repeat ourselves (we are NOT happy to repeat ourselves, I say!), we wrapped is in the component `comps.pageTitleRow`. So this code:

[source, scala]
----
@comps.pageTitleRow("My Fancy Page", "In this page, we enjoy subtitles as well as titles"){
  <button class="btn btn-primary">Add</button>
  <button class="btn btn-warning">Remove</button>
  <button class="btn btn-info">More Info</button>
}
----

Results in this page header:

.PageHeaderRow in action, shown here with title, sub-title, and three buttons as the optional extra HTML.

== Informationals

This is an infrastructure for UI messages (typically success/fail/info), that can be generated both from a controller, or from Javascript code on the client side. When created from a controller, they are passed over the `+flash+` scope, with the key `+FlashKeys.MESSAGE+` (this covers the common ``POST``-then-``REDIRECT`` pattern).

.Messages can have a title, a sub-title, a color, and a timeout.

Additional methods allow blocking the UI (e.g. for full page data load), showing background progress, and prompting the user with YES/NO questions.

.Yes/No question

.Background progress

[TIP]
To view and experiment (live!) with the Informationals library, start PSPS and navigate to the menu:Components[Informationals] page.

== Pagers

Having to page through a long list of data is a very common task. PSPS handles this with the `views.PaginationInfo` case class, and the `@comps.pager` partial template. For example, when `pi` is a `PaginationInfo` instance with `currentPage`=3 and `pageCount`=23, the following code:

[source, scala]
----
@comps.pager(pi){i=>@routes.HomeCtrl.pager(i)}
----

... will result in:

image::pager.png[]


== `views.Helpers`

This class contains functions that handle many common use-cases, such as date formatting, and conditional rendering. This is also a good place to put additional useful methods (we're happy to take pull requests!).
