== Play seed project setups
include::_attributes.adoc[]

PSPS is a regular Play application. As such, it does not need much setup beyond an available JVM. This page shows how to set up PSPS, or relevant external systems. If you want to start playing with it, we recommend downloading the source, setting up a database (see below) and running it using `sbt`.

=== Database

PSPS uses PostgreSQL for storing user data. To set up a database in PostgreSQL, open the `psql` console ant type the following commands.

* `+create role base_app_user with password 'base_app_pass';+`
* `+create database base_app with template=template0 LC_COLLATE='C';+`
* `+grant ALL PRIVILEGES on DATABASE base_app TO base_app_user;+`
* `+ALTER ROLE base_app_user WITH LOGIN;+`
* On some configurations, you also need to adjust user authentication
** Need to edit the permission file. See where itâ€™s located by typing: `+SHOW hba_file;+`
** from local using password by adding the below line at the top:
+
`+host   base_app          base_app_user                                  md5+`
+
(for local unix sockets, use `+local+` rather than `+host+`)
** Now reload the configuration by typing in psql console:
`+select pg_reload_conf();+`

=== Adding users

Add first user by ``POST``ing the following json to
`$SERVER/bkofc/api/users`:

*NOTE*: This endpoint is available from localhost only.

[source, json]
----
{
  username: "<username>",
  password: "<password>",
  email: "<email>"
}
----

[NOTE]
The `add-user` script in the _scripts_ allows adding users from the command-line (using this API behind the scenes).

[TIP]
  The `bkofc` part of the endpoint URL stands for "back office".

=== Email Setup

PSPS sends emails in certain events (forgotten password, user
invitations etc.). To allow this, you must update the `+play.mailer+`
part of the configuration with the details of the sending email account.


=== Setting up 

When running the application from the commandline, don't forget to point it to the correct configuration file. the command below does that, and allows forward0only evolutions (only `!Ups`, no `!Downs`).

[source, bash]
----
./current/bin/base-app -Dconfig.file=./current/conf/server.conf -Dplay.evolutions.db.default.autoApply=true
----
