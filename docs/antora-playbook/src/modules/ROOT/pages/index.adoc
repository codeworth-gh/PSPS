= PSPS
:experimental:

Play-Scala-Postgres-Slick stack, by http://codeworth.io[CodeWorth.io] and the http://playframework.com[Play Framework] community.

== Overview

image:PSPSdemo.gif[Demo]

=== What is this?

A seed project for websites that have user accounts, a public side, and
database connectivity.

=== Why

http://playframework.com[Play framework] is a very powerful, and a very
non-opinionated, web platform. It’s a please to use, but we found
ourselves implementing standard functionality over and over again. Thus,
we decided to just write it once, properly (we hope) and then fork when
needed.

==== Why not Sub-Class Play?

Sure, that’s the textbook way of doing it. But it’s impractical,
especially as Play goes through an evolution of its own (and a
non-backward-compatible one, too). Additionally, Play is large enough to
have a non-trivial learning curve. Which is added to Scala’s non-trivial
learning curve. That’s enough curves.

=== Who

CodeWorth.io (as in: "`us`") is a software studio that creates custom
software systems. When we develop web systems, and are free to choose a
technology stack, we tend to use Play+Scala. PSPS is a consolidation of
the knowledge and practices we’ve accumulated over the last few years,
doing http://ecf.org.il[numerous] http://index.genevainitiative.org[web]
http://decision-trees.force11.org[sites] (plus some we can’t list here
yet).

=== How

PSPS uses the following technologies: 

* The http://scala-lang.org[Scala] variant of http://playframework.com[Play Framework].
* http://postgres.org[PostgreSQL] 
* http://slick.lightbend.com/[Slick] As the database connectivity layer 
* http://getbootstrap.com[Bootstrap4] 
* User-based access control, using https://deadbolt-scala.readme.io[Deadbolt]. 
* Client-side localization using https://github.com/airbnb/polyglot.js[AirBnB's Polyglot.js].
* Custom code and templates

==== To use PSPS

Just fork it, and change the code as needed (that’s how you use a seed
project, right?)

== What does PSPS have, out of its proverbial box?

=== Users Accounts

Including "`forgot password`" and "`invite user`" flows, profile editing
page, and logged-in only sections. Users can log on using their username
_or_ email. Database constraints prevent duplicate entries of both emails and usernames.

=== Site Navigation Tree and NavBar

Using pre-defined tree structure, developers can describe the site
navigation structure. The UI templates will draw the structure,
including drop-down items etc. The structure can be dynamic or static.
Two sample structures are defined in `+views.Helpers+`

[source,scala]
----
val publicItems:Seq[TopSiteSection[PublicSections.Value]] = Seq(
   PageSection("Public Home", PublicSections.Home, routes.HomeCtrl.index),
   PageSection("Login", PublicSections.Login, routes.HomeCtrl.index),
   MultiPageSection("Other", PublicSections.Others,
     Seq(
       PageSectionItem("Login", routes.HomeCtrl.index),
       SeparatorSectionItem,
       PageSectionItem("Public Home", routes.HomeCtrl.index)
     )
   )
 )
----

=== Logged-in Template

Complete with user account, btn:[logout] button, etc.

=== Success/Fail/Warn Messages

Are passed over the `+flash+` scope, with the key `+FlashKeys.MESSAGE+`.
They are automatically shown to the user by the `+bsBase+` template. You
can either pass a String (which will result in an "`info`" message), or
a full-fledged `+Informational+`.

=== Playjax

JS Library to make JS6 `+fetch+` calls using Play’s JS Routers. Supports
CSRF, by adding an HTML element with id `+Playjax_csrfTokenValue+` and
value of the current CSRF token.

[source,javascript]
----
function resendEmail(uuid){
    new Playjax(beRoutes).using(c=>c.UserCtrl.apiReInviteUser(uuid)).fetch()
        .then( resp => {
            if (resp.ok) {
                Informationals.makeSuccess("Invitation re-sent", "", 1500).show();
            } else {
                Informationals.makeDanger("Re-sending the invitation failed", "", 1500).show();
            }
        });
}
----

=== More

* _Localization support_ Using standard Play localization.
* _Separate front-end and back-office JS Routers_ for better security.
* _Convenience methods for template rendering_ in `+views.Helpers+`.
* Template for social media page metadata
