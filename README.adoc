= PSPS

**A Play-Scala-PostgreSQL-Slick stack for web applications. Created by http://codeworth.io[CodeWorth.io] and the http://playframework.com[Play Framework] community.**

== Overview

=== What is this?

PSPS is a seed project for websites that have user accounts, a public side, and
database connectivity. It is targeted at small-to-medium sites, that can use a single main monolith part. In other words, if you need a microservice-based cloud native hyper-distributed app, that's not it. If you need a website that can be hosted on a VPS, have a public and a back-office parts, and scale up nicely, PSPS is a good start.

PSPS is based on our experience with Play for creating such websites. We have sites in production that handle thousands of visitors per month, living on a $4/month VPS.
